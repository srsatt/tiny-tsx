# TinyTSX hono actor benchmark (8 worker(s))

Generated: 2026-07-18T11:14:06+00:00

> Scope: one persistent signed counter actor behind a pinned Hono ask/reply route; zero-delta reads through bounded copied messages; HTTP/1.1; localhost. HTTP/1.1 connections are reused; one server process. This is not a general dynamic-language benchmark.

## Environment

- Machine: Model Name: MacBook Pro; Model Identifier: Mac17,6; Chip: Apple M5 Max; Total Number of Cores: 18 (6 Super and 12 Performance); Memory: 128 GB
- OS: macOS 26.5.2
- TinyTSX commit: `932743e`
- Bun: 1.3.13
- oha: oha 1.15.0
- Runs per point: 3
- Duration per run: 15 seconds

## Footprint and startup

| Target | First launch | Startup median | Idle RSS median | Post-warm-up RSS median | Peak sampled RSS | App artifact | Runtime executable |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| TinyTSX | 451.11 ms | 23.10 ms | 6.41 MiB | 6.67 MiB | 6.98 MiB | 2.26 MiB | 2.26 MiB |
| Bun | 26.66 ms | 18.19 ms | 44.55 MiB | 106.91 MiB | 147.39 MiB | 0.90 KiB | 60.15 MiB |

Bun's application script and runtime executable are reported separately; the runtime is required in deployment but may be shared by multiple applications.
Idle RSS is sampled after one correctness request; post-warm-up RSS is sampled after one second at maximum concurrency.
Peak RSS is sampled from the server every 20 ms throughout warm-up and all load points.

## Process and optional allocation pressure

| Target | Server CPU | CPU utilization | Unix syscalls | Mach syscalls | Context switches | Page faults | Open FDs start/peak/end |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| TinyTSX | 71.68 s | 228.1% | 30,953,979 | 2,868,264 | 4,643,969 | 38 | 4/68/4 |
| Bun | 43.23 s | 137.1% | 10,101,972 | 8,361,724 | 1,924,353 | 6,679 | 6/70/6 |

Counters are per measured server process from warm-up through the final load point; medians are across runs.
Open file descriptors are sampled every 20 ms; start and end are taken around the measured warm-up and load interval.

| TinyTSX allocator | Calls | Reallocations | Requested bytes | Peak live bytes | Live bytes at shutdown |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Global allocator | disabled | disabled | disabled | disabled | disabled |

Allocator counters are disabled for this comparison, so the TinyTSX throughput path has no instrumentation overhead.

## Response contract

- Status: 200
- Body: `"0"` (1 bytes)

- Bun Content-Type: `text/plain; charset=UTF-8`
- TinyTSX framing: `1`
- Bun framing: `1`

## Throughput and latency

| Concurrency | TinyTSX req/s | Bun req/s | Tiny/Bun | Tiny p50 | Bun p50 | Tiny p99 | Bun p99 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 34,918 | 92,274 | 0.38x | 0.118 ms | 0.081 ms | 0.348 ms | 0.151 ms |
| 64 | 66,797 | 106,091 | 0.63x | 0.122 ms | 0.482 ms | 13.668 ms | 1.231 ms |

Medians are computed across all recorded runs; no samples are discarded. Raw samples are retained in the adjacent JSON report.

## Limitations

- TinyTSX uses 8 fixed native worker(s); keep-alive is true.
- The benchmark client and server share the same machine.
- TinyTSX uses its local actor mailbox while Bun uses one Worker-owned counter; the zero-delta route measures ownership/message overhead without persistence, mutation contention, supervision, or distributed actors.
- TinyTSX bounds each connection at 100 requests and reconnects; the Bun host may retain a connection longer.
- Power mode and unrelated background activity are not controlled by the harness.
